# JQuery-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

After understanding jQuery and seeing how so much faster I can write JavaScript code, I decided to dig into jQuery more to see its full potential. The problem was that I could easily lose track of time, so I created a workday scheudler to keep track of my schedule during the workday.

## Installation

You can access this page with the following URL:
https://jmcmillenmusic.github.io/jquery-work-day-scheduler/

## Usage

Today's date is displayed at the top for reference. The fields are color-coded depending on the current hour (past, present, and future). Click in any field and type a task that you want to save to that time slot. Click the blue Save button on the right to save the task to the time slot. You can save a new task to this if you change your mind by repeating this process. If the page gets refreshed or closed and reopened, you'll be able to come back to this and see all of the tasks you've entered still there.
